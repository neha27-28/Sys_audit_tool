# Final Output & Features â€“ Insp3ct++ Audit Tool

---

## Final Output

The Insp3ct++ Audit Tool delivers a comprehensive intranet-based auditing solution. It combines a lightweight Windows client executable (`Insp3ct++.exe`) with a centralized PHP-MySQL web dashboard. The final deliverables include:

- Structured XML reports generated from each client machine.
- Audit logs securely stored in a MySQL database.
- Real-time web dashboard for monitoring system status and viewing reports.
- Historical audit data and login patterns tracked per machine.
- High-level system overviews with optional anomaly detection (e.g., unauthorized USB usage, CPU spikes).
- Downloadable audit reports in both XML and JSON formats.

## Key Features

### 1. User Authentication System
- Role-based access control:
  - Administrators have full access to all functionalities including audit control, logs, and reports.
  - Regular users have limited access, typically restricted to viewing their own machine's data.

### 2. Smart Audit Client (`Insp3ct++.exe`)
- A standalone and portable Windows application.
- Collects detailed system-level data including:
  - Operating System details
  - CPU, memory, disk information
  - Connected USB devices
  - Network interface data
- Converts system information into an XML report.
- Transmits the report to the server via secure HTTP POST requests.

### 3. Centralized Data Logging
- MySQL database schema includes:
  - `users` table for authentication and role assignment.
  - `logins` table for recording login timestamps and user sessions.
  - `system_logs` table for storing the actual audit reports (XML format).

### 4. Web-Based Admin Dashboard
- Provides a centralized interface for administrators to:
  - View and manage audit history.
  - Monitor last login and audit activity by machine.
  - Track device and user audit frequency.
  - Download reports for offline analysis.
  - Apply filters for quick data retrieval and visualization.

### 5. Anomaly Detection (Optional Phase)
- Identifies irregularities in system behavior such as:
  - New USB device insertions
  - Unusual CPU usage patterns
  - Irregular or failed login attempts
- Notifications or alerts displayed on the dashboard for further action.

### 6. Export Options
- Reports can be exported in:
  - XML format for structured, machine-readable audit logs.
  - JSON format for easier integration with external systems and tools.

### 7. File and Directory Structure
- The executable runs independently on each client system.
- The server hosts:
  - `upload.php` to receive and process audit data.
  - Web portal files including login, dashboard, and report views.
  - Report storage either in the database or an organized file directory.
